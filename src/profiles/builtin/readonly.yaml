# Read-only preset - safe browsing without write access
#
# Use this preset when you need to explore a GitLab instance
# without any risk of modifying data.
#
# All write operations (create, update, delete) are blocked.
#
# NOTE: This is a PRESET, not a full profile.
# It does NOT contain host or auth - those come from your
# environment variables (GITLAB_API_URL, GITLAB_TOKEN).
