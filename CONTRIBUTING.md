## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp/issues/new) with steps to reproduce, the client you're using (Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor, etc.), the transport (stdio / SSE / streamable HTTP), and the relevant environment variables.
- **Request a feature** — open an issue describing the GitLab capability you want exposed and why it matters for your workflow.
- **Submit a fix or new tool** — fork the repo and open a pull request (details below).
- **Improve the docs** — the [docs site](https://zereight.github.io/gitlab-mcp/) is generated from `docs/`. PRs that clarify a setup guide, fix a broken link, or add a missing example are very welcome.

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool           | Version              | Notes                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js        | **22.21.1**          | Pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc). Use `nvm use` to match. |
| npm            | bundled with Node 22 |                                                       |
| Git            | any recent version   |                                                       |
| Python 3.10+   | (only for docs)      | Required if you want to preview the docs site.        |
| GitLab account | optional             | Needed only for live integration tests.               |

### Clone, install, build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp.git
cd gitlab-mcp
nvm use            # or: nvm install
npm install
npm run build      # compiles TypeScript to build/
```

### Run the server locally

```bash
# Personal Access Token (stdio transport, the default for local clients)
GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=glpat-xxxx \
GITLAB_API_URL=https://gitlab.com/api/v4 \
  node build/index.js
```

Watch mode for faster iteration:

```bash
npm run watch      # tsc --watch in one terminal
node build/index.js   # restart this as needed in another
```

See [Environment Variables](docs/configuration/environment-variables.md) for
the complete list of flags the server understands.

```

When adding a new tool:

1. Define the input schema in [`schemas.ts`](schemas.ts) — use `z.object({…}).describe(...)` on each field; the generated docs depend on those descriptions.
2. Register it in [`tools/registry.ts`](tools/registry.ts) — add to `allTools` with a `name`, `description`, and `inputSchema`, then add the name to the appropriate `TOOLSET_DEFINITIONS` entry.
3. Implement the dispatch case in [`index.ts`](index.ts) under the relevant `switch` block.
4. Add a test under `test/`.
5. Regenerate the tool docs (`make tools-docs`, see below).

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:mock        # Fast unit + mock-server tests. Run these locally.
npm run test:all         # mock + live; live tests need a real GitLab token.
npm run test:schema      # JSON schema validation.
npm run test:oauth       # OAuth2 flow against the mock server.
npm run test:stateless   # Multi-pod / stateless OAuth helpers.
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-test.yml))
runs `test:mock`, `test:consumer-smoke`, and `npx tsc --noEmit` on every PR.
Make sure those pass locally before pushing.

### Live integration tests

```bash
GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=glpat-xxxx \
GITLAB_API_URL=https://gitlab.com/api/v4 \
  npm run test:live
```

Live tests touch a real GitLab instance — use a throwaway sandbox project,
not anything you care about.

## Code style

| Tool             | Command                | Purpose                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Prettier         | `npm run format`       | Formats `*.{js,ts,json,md}`. |
| Prettier (check) | `npm run format:check` | CI gate.                     |
| ESLint           | `npm run lint`         | TypeScript lint.             |
| ESLint (autofix) | `npm run lint:fix`     | Auto-fix where possible.     |
| TypeScript       | `npx tsc --noEmit`     | Type check.                  |

Conventions enforced by CI:

- **No stray `console.log`** in `*.ts` (test files are exempt). Use proper logging.
- **No `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX`** comments in committed code — open an issue instead.
- **Strict TypeScript** — the build runs `tsc` with the settings in [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json).

## Submitting changes

1. **Branch** from `main`. Use a descriptive name:

   - `feat/<short-description>` for new features or new tools
   - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
   - `docs/<short-description>` for docs-only changes
   - `chore/<short-description>` for refactors, deps, CI tweaks

2. **Commit messages** — short, present-tense, lowercase prefix matching the branch type:

   ```
   feat: add list_dependency_proxy_blobs tool
   fix: handle 429 rate-limit on get_merge_request
   docs: clarify OAuth redirect URI for Cursor
   ```

   We don't enforce Conventional Commits strictly, but the changelog
   generator (`npm run changelog`) groups commits by these prefixes.

3. **Pull request** — open against `main`. In the description, include:

   - **What** changed (one paragraph).
   - **Why** — link an issue if there is one.
   - **How tested** — which `npm test` commands ran, and any manual
     verification with a real MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).
   - **Breaking changes** — call them out explicitly.

4. **CI must pass** — `pr-test.yml` runs the mock test suite, type check,
   lint, Docker build, formatting check, and `npm audit`. Address all real
   failures; the existing "warning" steps (e.g., the TODO grep) are
   informational.

5. **Review** — a maintainer will review. We try to respond within a few
   days. Small, focused PRs get merged fastest.

## Documentation contributions

The docs at [zereight.github.io/gitlab-mcp](https://zereight.github.io/gitlab-mcp/)
are generated from `docs/` with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

```bash
make serve         # preview locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000/gitlab-mcp/
make build         # strict build (same as CI)
make tools-docs    # regenerate per-group tool pages from tools/registry.ts
```

**When changing tools, schemas, or toolsets:**

The per-group tool pages under `docs/tools/` are **generated** from
`tools/registry.ts` and the Zod schemas. After adding/renaming a tool, run:

```bash
make tools-docs
```

and commit the regenerated files alongside your code change. The docs CI
workflow ([`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml))
rebuilds and deploys the site on every push to `main` that touches `docs/`,
`mkdocs.yml`, `requirements-docs.txt`, `tools/registry.ts`, `schemas.ts`,
or `scripts/generate-tool-docs.ts`.

**Hosted site (maintainers, one-time):** GitHub Pages must use
**Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**, not deploy from `main`.
See [`docs/reference/github-pages-setup.md`](docs/reference/github-pages-setup.md).

**When changing prose docs:**

Just edit the markdown under `docs/` and run `make serve` to preview.
`mkdocs build --strict` (run by CI) will fail on broken internal links, so
keep cross-references accurate.

## Release process

Releases are cut by maintainers via `scripts/release.sh` and published to
npm via [`npm-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml). External
contributors don't need to do anything for release — the maintainer will
handle versioning and the changelog.

## Getting help

- **Questions about usage** — open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp/discussions) or a discussion-style issue.
- **Sensitive reports** (security, conduct) — email the maintainers via the address listed in the repo's `package.json` / npm page rather than filing a public issue.

Thanks for contributing!
